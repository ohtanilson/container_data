\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We construct a new unified panel dataset of route-year-level freight rate and shipping quantity in the six major routes and industry-year-level newbuilding, secondhand, and scrap prices from 1966 (the beginning of the industry) to 2009. We provide a detailed guidance about how to merge multiple data and verify the consistency of the data with the historical knowledge and experience of industry experts, ex-chairperson and ex-vice chairperson. Using the data, we provide a descriptive analysis of the industry dynamics that has been quantitatively unknown. Finally, we detect structural breaks for each univariate time series data to illustrate the effect of the breakdown of shipping cartels.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

The container shipping industry is a fascinating laboratory for investigating industry dynamics. Because the industry started a global shipping business in 1966, we can determine the initial state of the market dynamic structure with substantial firm entry and exit. Another feature is that many countries have exemption agreements that include international cartels and consortia in their competition laws.\footnote{\cite{Anteitekina_kokusaikaijouyusoukakuhonotameno_kaijiseisakuno_arikatanitsuite2007} of the Ministry of Land, Infrastracture and Transportation in Japan defines shipping conference as an agreement on freight rates and other business matters to restrain competition among container shipping lines for the same routes. A consortium is a technical agreement between several shipping lines to form a group and operate a joint service for the diversification of services, a reduction of the investment scale, and a cost reduction in the liner service. In addition, consortiums include alliances that are widely used. } In the shipping industry, international shipping cartels are called ``shipping conferences".\footnote{There is an important difference between shipping conferences and alliances:conferences are organized by specific routes and directions, while alliances are formed globally. There may exist one conference covering trade on the transatlantic route and another covering trade between Northern Europe and US Gulf ports. In addition, firms do not always participate in conferences on all the routes and directions they serve. Thus, conferences are very heterogeneous in their structure and membership.} Despite the importance, there has not been a panel dataset of route-year-level freight rate and shipping quantity in the container shipping industry, particularly covering the period between 1966 and 1990, so quantitative research on the period is limited.\footnote{As other related papers focusing on the container freight rate panel data, \cite{luo2009econometric} use shipping demand and freight rate data between 1980 and 2007. As a shipping demand, they used the world container throughput reported in the Drewry Annual Container Market Review and Forecast. The container freight rate, which is calculated as the weighted average of transpacific, Europe-Far East, and transatlantic trades from the same data source. Due to data limitations, they calculate the missing period (1980–1993) from the General Freight Index in the Shipping Statistics Yearbook 2007, using a simple statistical equation between the container freight rate and the general freight index from 1994 to 2008.} This paper provides guidance to construct the unified dataset based on published books and publicly available data sources as much as possible. We also merge route-year-level data with new industry-level data regarding shipbuilding, secondhand, and scrap prices.\footnote{The data sources are listed in Appendix \ref{sec:data_construction}.} 

We take the tractable imputation approach, that is, linking multiple data sources, which overlaps information in some years, instead of constructing the freight index manually from the commodity-level freight rate via a formal but complicated processes or taking an estimation approach assuming AR(1) process under stationarity \citep{jeon2017learning}. We check the validity by showing the interview-based evidence of ex-executive officers of shipping companies. It confirms that our TEU-based price data provides one of the reasonable benchmark measures, although container freight rates were not determined by container units in the 1970s.

Using our new dataset, we implement the unknown multiple structural breaks test \citep{bai1998estimating,bai2003computation} to analyze historical shipping price reductions in the 1980s known as the ``container crisis" \citep{broeze2002globalisation}. It has been anecdotally known that the crisis was triggered by the two events: (1) the withdrawal of Sea-Land, which was the biggest cartel member from shipping cartels in 1980 and (2) the enactment of the Shipping Act of 1984. The first event changed the market share of shipping cartels, while the second event neutralized the shipping cartels. We also apply the test to the industry-year-level newbuilding, secondhand, and scrap prices to find the relationship with shipping markets and shipbuilding markets.

Given the test, first, we find that container crisis occurred in all six routes at the latest in 1980 triggered by the withdrawal of Sea-Land, although non-US routes reacted earlier than US routes. Second, we find that the industry-year-level newbuilding and scrap prices have similar patterns to the shipping price. On the other hand, the secondhand price shows a stable trend under the container crisis.


\subsection{Related literature}\label{subsec:litereture}

This paper contributes to two strands of the literature: historical connection to the recent growing empirical research on the shipping industry and the effect of an explicit cartel on the price in the shipping industry.

First, this paper provides the necessary data to connect the history of the container shipping industry from its beginning to its development after 2000, which has gained attention in industrial organization literature \citep{aguirregabiria2021dynamic}. The most relevant paper is \cite{jeon2017learning}. She examines the relationship between demand uncertainty and a firm-market-year-level investment decisions by using container shipping demand and freight rate data between 1997 and 2014. To facilitate her learning-based model, she needs to obtain initial prices and demand in the container industry. Due to her data limitation, she takes imputation and truncation approaches for missing shipping demand data from 1966:Q2 to 1996:Q4.\footnote{On cartel issues in a similar industry, the most relevant paper is \cite{asker2010leniency}. He studies how the presence of a cartel affects market conduct following its dissolution, and how the dissolution might be affected by the obligations imposed on firms who seek leniency in the  tanker shipping market between 2001 and 2002. \cite{kalouptsidi2014aer}, \cite{brancaccio2020geography}, and \cite{greenwood2015waves} investigate the bulk shipping industry after 2000. \cite{bai2021congestion} study a tanker market during 2017-2020 and investigate how the imbalance between the demand for, and the supply of, shipping services
determines congestion. Although these industries are closely related to the container shipping industry, each of the industries is characterized differently because the market structure and competition are different. Also, \cite{kalouptsidi2017res} and \cite{barwick2019china} study the shipbuilding industry, which is an upstream industry for the container and bulk shipping industries. These papers rely on the use of Clarksons Research database and focus on the period after 2000. In the literature on international trade, \cite{bernhofen2016estimating} use country-level panel data regarding containerization adoption for the period 1962–1990. They focus on the effect of containerization adoption on the trade quantity, so they refer to \textit{the Containerization International Yearbook} only for obtaining the first presence of container technology in each country. \cite{rua2014diffusion} adds port-level data to their study and investigates diffusion of initial adoptions of containerized transportation. \cite{cocsar2018shipping} exploit rich Turkish export data and examine modal choice between containerization and breakbulk shipping.} Our paper and data overcome the limitation and complements the findings of previous studies.  



Second, this papeer detects the effect of the explicit shipping cartels on the shipping prices.\footnote{\textcolor{blue}{A companion paper (Matsuda and Otani 2022) investigates the effect by constructing a structural model and focuses on the shipping conferences as a single explicit cartel entity, and departs from the traditional focus on tacit collusion in the literature, e.g., \cite{porter1983study}, \cite{bresnahan1987competition}, \cite{miller2017understanding}, and \cite{byrne2019learning}. Otani (2022) also incorporates dynamic investment decisions with the cartel mechanism and unobserved correlated productivity.} The institutional background is close to \cite{igami2015market}'s findings. He studies the impact of market power on international coffee prices, and evaluates the impact of a cartel treaty on coffee prices and its global welfare consequences under counterfactual competition regimes, i.e., collusion versus Cournot–Nash in a single homogenous good market. \cite{miller2017understanding} take a similar identification strategy for a specific merger to test a conduct parameter between Bertrand–Nash and collusion in the US beer industry in differentiated goods markets. \cite{clark2013collusion,clark2014effect} studied explicit price-fixing cartels in the Canadian gasoline market by applying a differences-in-differences approach to collusive and competitive markets. There are several case studies, such as sugar production \citep{genesove1998testing,genesove2001rules}, bidding rings \citep{asker2010study}, gasoline pricing \citep{clark2013collusion,clark2014effect}, global coffee cartels \citep{igami2015market}, collusive beer pricing \citep{miller2017understanding}, and global vitamin cartels \citep{igami2021measuring}.} Shipping cartels are recognized in survey papers such as those by \cite{levenstein2006determines}, and \cite{asker2021}. Some studies, such as those of \cite{morton1997entry} and \cite{podolny1999social}, examine the specific shipping cartels in the UK in the 1800s. The most relevant papers are \cite{wilson1991some}, \cite{pirrong1992application}, and \cite{clyde1998market}. \cite{wilson1991some} provide evidence on the regime change by the Shipping Act of 1984 using data of quarterly freight rates and shipping quantities of the five selected commodities only on the transpacific route. \cite{pirrong1992application} tests the model prediction of core theory surveyed in \cite{sjostrom2013competition} using the data of two specific trade routes between 1983 and 1985. \cite{clyde1998market} study the relationship between market power and the market share of shipping conferences after the act. However, they do not exploit cross-sectional variations especially between non-US and US routes. Our data contains cross-sectional variations of the freight rates. Thus, as far as we know, due to data limitations, our paper is the first empirical paper detecting the effect of shipping cartels on the six main routes after the global containerization in the 1970s.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:data} summarizes the data and institutional background of the container shipping industry. Section \ref{sec:interview} shows the interview-based evidence of an ex-chairperson and an ex-vice chairperson to show the consistency of our recovered data. Section \ref{sec:structural_break_test} implement structural break tests to detect price reductions on market variables. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} offers our conclusions. Appendix \ref{sec:data_construction} shows the detail of data construction.

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

We provide details of the data source in Section \ref{subsec:data}. Next, we provide the graphical interpretations in Section \ref{subsec:graphical_interpretation} and summary statistics of the variables in Section \ref{subsec:summary_statistics}. Following the literature, a \textit{market} in this industry is a nondirectional location pair, i.e., if a firm operates a container ship in the eastbound of the transpacific, then it should operate the ship in the westbound. A \textit{route} is a directional round-trip between two locations, e.g., both westbound and eastbound of the transpacific. An \textit{industry} is a whole market consisting of all six routes.

\subsection{Data Source}\label{subsec:data}
We construct route-year-level and industry-year-level data of the container shipping industry.\footnote{\textcolor{blue}{Matsuda and Otani (2022) use additional firm-market-year-level data to investigate cartel markets before the shipping Act in 1984.} Thanks to the firm-level data, each route is divided into conference and non-conference routes. For example, the transatlantic eastbound conference route is a single route and the transatlantic conference market is a single market. A conference market is a market where all conference firms conducted collusive behavior under the shipping conferences before the Shipping Act, but have competed since the Act, whereas a non-conference market is a market where all non-conference firms have competed throughout the whole period. In the interview with an ex-practitioners in shipping companies, they told that container freight rates for nonmember carriers are 20\% to 30\% lower than conference firms on the same routes. However, there was no data available on the trends in freight rates offered by the non-conference carriers. In addition, although we checked \textit{The Japan Maritime Daily}, the newspaper of the maritime industry, we could not find any articles that continuously reported on the level of freight rates offered by the non-conference carriers. As far as we know, the price data in non-conference markets is not available.} First, we use route-year-level data of the container freight rate and shipping quantity. Collecting the data, in particular before 1994, is not trivial because there is no single data source that covers the period between 1966 and 1993. Thus, we need to combine the data from multiple data sources carefully.\footnote{For reference, we merge \textit{``Issues of Our Ocean Shipping"} (\textit{``Wagakuni no Gaikou Kaiun Ni Tsuite", in Japanese}), \textit{Global Container Markets Drewry Shipping Consultants}, \textit{Review of Maritime Transport}, \textit{Containerization International 1973}, \textit{World Sea Trade Service}, \textit{Container transportation cost and profitability 1980/2000}, \textit{The Container Crisis 1982}, \textit{World Container Data 1985}, and \textit{World's sea trades}. Then, we convert merged data into TEU-based data.} In Appendix \ref{sec:data_construction}, we provide the data source and a detailed guide with some assumptions on data construction for each of the container freight rates and shipping quantities on major six routes: mainhaul and backhaul (separately) on the transpacific (Asia and North America), transatlantic (North America and Europe), and Asia-Europe routes. Finally, we use the price and quantity data in the six routes between 1966 and 2009. The price is adjusted to the CPI in the U.S. in 1995. To check the accuracy and validity, in Section \ref{sec:interview}, we provide interview-based evidence on the consistency of our recovered data with historical experience of industry experts, Akimitsu Ashida and Hiroyuki Sato.

Second, we use industry-year-level data of newbuilding, secondhand, and scrap prices.\footnote{For reference, we merge \textit{Review (1971-1998)} and \textit{Lloyd's Shipping Economist (1983-1990)}. Then, we convert merged data into TEU-based data.} In Appendix \ref{sec:data_construction}, we provide the data source and a detailed guide with some assumptions on data construction. Finally, we use the newbuilding and scrap prices per TEU between 1966 and 1998 and the secondhand price per TEU between 1968 and 1998. The prices are adjusted to the CPI in the U.S. in 1995. 

Note that the recent data of newbuilding, secondhand, and scrap prices after 1998 and shipping price and quantity after 2009 are sold by companies such as Clarksons and IHS Markit. Our data can be merged with these proprietary data. To share our data for public use, this paper does not include these proprietary data.

\subsection{Graphical interpretation}\label{subsec:graphical_interpretation}
\subsubsection{Route-year-level shipping price and quantity data}



Figure \ref{fg:container_freight_rate_and_shipping_quantity_each_route} illustrates the nonstationary trends of the container freight rate and shipping quantity between 1966 and 1990. The container freight rate decreases with fluctuations, and suddenly drops tremendously. However, as a remarkable feature, the transition of freight rates on Asia-Europe eastbound (Europe to Asia) and westbound (Asia to Europe) routes are more unstable than that of transpacific and transatlantic routes in the 1970s and 1980s. It might be because the strength of the shipping conference on the Asia-Europe route decreased, and its impact was more significant.\footnote{In the interview with an ex-executive of a Japanese shipping company, he pointed out the difference between conferences. Conferences related to Asia-Europe had a strict membership screening process, and the number of voyages by member companies was clearly defined (closed conference). In addition, some members in the conference pooled their freight and then redistributed them. In contrast, the conferences for transpacific routes were free to join or leave (open conference), and freight pooling was explicitly prohibited under the Shipping Act of 1916 in the US} 

The shipping quantity in all routes increases monotonically between 1973 and 1990. In particular, after 2000, the trend of shipping quantity increases exponentially, in particular, in transpacific eastbound and Asia-Europe eastbound routes due to the surge in import from Asian countries especially China. These features after 2000 are investigated in detail by \cite{jeon2017learning}. 

The enactment of the Shipping Act of 1984 in the US divides the conference markets regime sharply before and after 1984, which is illustrated in the trend of the container freight rate in Figure \ref{fg:container_freight_rate_and_shipping_quantity_each_route}. Under the legislation of the Shipping Act of 1984 in the US, shipping conferences were much easier to form and had greater antitrust immunity for routes to call US ports. Also, after 1984, the transpacific and transatlantic routes have experienced severe price reduction via market competition.\footnote{This is consistent with an interview article to ex-executives of Japanese shipping companies \citep{JapanMaritimeDaily2006} that were in charge of container trades in the 1980s.} The change of the market regime shaped the container crisis.

   Note: The container freight rates before 1992 refer to conference prices. The container freight rates after 1993 are the unified prices based on the conference and non-conference prices, and the difference between them are known to be vanished due to the Shipping Act of 1984. The latter data is standard data often used in the literature such as \cite{jeon2017learning}. The prices are adjusted to the CPI in the U.S. in 1995.

\caption{The trend of industry-year level newbuilding, secondhand, and scrap prices.}
\label{fg:price_newbuilding_secondhand_scrap}
\end{center}
\footnotesize
The data spans 32 years (1966-1998) of the whole container shipping industry. Data covers newbuilding and scrap prices between 1966 and 1998 and secondhand price between 1968 and 1998. All prices are adjusted to the CPI in the U.S. in 1995. 
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fg:price_newbuilding_secondhand_scrap} illustrates the transitions of the newbuilding, secondhand, and scrap prices. First, we observe three peaks of the newbuilding price in 1975, 1980, and 1989, which indicates that the newbuilding price shows a pattern similar to the shipping price. \textcolor{blue}{[We interpret that the ship itself was expensive in the 1970s and the shipbuilding price per TEU had decreased in the 1990s due to the gradual increase in the size of ships.]}\textcolor{blue}{[Add explanation]}

Second, the secondhand price decreases between 1975 and 1978. On the other hand, the price after 1979 is stable relative to the shipping and newbuilding prices. \textcolor{blue}{[Add explanation]}

Third, the scrap price is stable without any large fluctuation relative to the other price variables.  \textcolor{blue}{[Add explanation]}

%   Note: Conference and non-conference market shares are calculated by the tonnage share of ships deployed in the westbound and eastbound of the market. We highlight the market share of Sea-Land, which had a key role in the conference market.
% \end{figure} 

% Second, we use ship-level data from a series in \textit{the Containerization International Yearbook} (CIY). We use information on the build year, the name of the ship operator, the deployed route, the shipping capacity measured by the twenty-foot equipment units (TEU). We assign the main three routes (that is, transatlantic, transpacific, and Asia-Europe) to all ships deployed on the routes, including subareas. Almost all ships are deployed in eastbound and westbound route in each assigned route.\footnote{The tonnage of ships deployed in multiple main routes is treated as the shipping capacity in ``Multiple" routes and omitted in the analysis because we could not identify the allocation of deployed ships to multiple routes. The ships deployed in multiple routes were going to be common only after 1980. Thus, we believe the effect of omitting these ships is limited.} We combine the ship-level data with the firm-market-year-level data of entry/exit in the market and joining/leaving conference and non-conference markets from various data sources \citep{DOT1992conference, kaiun_ni_okeru2004, NYTIMES1981, NYTIMES1983, VANHAM2012}.\footnote{We also used information from website of the port of Long Beach (\url{https://polb.com/port-info/timeline/}) other than the listed references.}

% Based on the tonnage share of the firm-market-year-level data, we calculate the shipping tonnage shares of conference and non-conference firms. For example, the transatlantic eastbound route has conference and non-conference routes independently. Figure \ref{fg:cartel_level_share_transition_asia_and_europe} illustrates the transitions of market shares of conference and non-conference firms and Sea-Land in each market, aggregating eastbound and westbound routes. Throughout all periods, the transatlantic market was going to be competitive because of the growing number and size of non-conference firms. On the other hand, the Asia-Europe market was dominated by conference firms, particularly before 1980. The transpacific market is the middle case. Remarkably, the withdrawal of Sea-Land from shipping conferences would affect the change of conference shares because it had the largest share in the transpacific and transatlantic markets.





\subsection{Summary statistics}\label{subsec:summary_statistics}

  \end{center}\footnotesize
  Note: The data spans 44 years (1966-2009) in Panel (a) of six routes. Transatlantic routes opened in 1966, transpacific routes in 1967, and Asia-Europe routes in 1971. For panel (a), the shipping prices before 1992 refer to conference prices, while the shipping prices after 1993 are the unified prices based on the conference and non-conference prices and the difference between them vanished due to the Shipping Act of 1984. The latter data is standard data often used in the literature such as \cite{jeon2017learning}. The data spans 32 years (1966-1998) in Panel (b) of the whole container shipping industry. Data covers newbuilding and scrap prices between 1966 and 1998 and secondhand price between 1968 and 1998. All prices are adjusted to the CPI in the U.S. in 1995. 
\end{table} 

Panel (a) in Table \ref{tb:summary_statistics} shows the summary statistics of route-year-level variables of shipping price $P_{rt}$ and quantity $Q_{rt}$. The data covers transatlantic routes opened in 1966, transpacific routes in 1967, and Asia-Europe routes in 1971.\footnote{For Table \ref{tb:summary_statistics}, the shipping prices before 1992 refer to conference prices, while the shipping prices after 1993 are unified prices based on conference and non-conference prices, while the difference between them vanished in the CIY. Thus, we observe full history of the conference market.} The shipping price is \$2105.35 per TEU on average. The shipping quantity is 2.34 million TEU on average. 

\subsubsection{Industry-year-level newbuilding, secondhand, and scrap prices data}

Panel (b) in Table \ref{tb:summary_statistics} shows the summary statistics of industry-year-level variables of newbuilding price $P_{t}^{new}$ and scrap price $P_{t}^{scrap}$ between 1966 and 1998 and secondhand price $P_{t}^{second}$ between 1968 and 1998. Newbuilding price per TEU is \$ 17324.17 on average. Secondhand price per TEU is \$18477.88 on average and less than newbuilding price after 1971. Scrap price per TEU is \$609.97 on average.

\subsection{Institutional Details}\label{subsec:institutional_details}
\textcolor{blue}{[TO BE CONCISE]}

We introduce the institutional background about the shipping conference in Section \ref{subsec:shipping_conference}, the early history of the container shipping industry in Section \ref{subsec:inception_of_container_shipping_industry}, and discuss two key events triggering the change of competition regime in Sections \ref{subsec:withdrawal_of_sea-land_from_cartel_in_1980} and \ref{subsec:shipping_act_of_1984}.

Under the Shipping Act of 1984, all carriers, both conference carriers and independent carriers, had to file their tariffs with the FMC. The FMC then policed those rates, issuing fines to carriers that engaged in secret discounting, known as "rebating". Under OSRA, carriers are obliged to make their freight rates publicly available, but the FMC's enforcement obligations are eliminated. OSRA's elimination of tariff-filing requirements and rate enforcement by the Federal Maritime Commission surely raises the cost to conferences of monitoring their members' pricing activities.

\subsubsection{Shipping conferences}\label{subsec:shipping_conference}


The world's first shipping conference is said to be the ``Calcutta Conference," which was formed in 1875 on the route between England and Calcutta to establish the unified freight rate.\footnote{In this subsection, we refer to \textit{The Actual State of Competition in Oceangoing Shipping and Problems with Competition Policy} (``Gaikoukaiun no Kyousoujittai To Kyousouseisakujou no Mondaiten ni Tsuite", in Japanese) reported by \cite{gaikoukaiun_no_kyousoujittai2006} of the Japan Fair Trade Commission,  \cite{branch2013maritime}, and \cite{sjostrom2013competition}. In particular, \cite{sjostrom1989collusion} discusses the economic insights of the shipping conferences from an historical viewpoint. \cite{morton1997entry} provide detailed historical evidence on British shipping industry before 1900.} In 1879, the Chinese Alliance, the ancestor organization of the Far East Freight Conference, formed on routes between Asia and Europe.\footnote{\cite{sjostrom2004ocean} conducted a survey on shipping conferences, and pointed out that systems similar to shipping conferences had existed in Atlantic shipping and British coastal shipping before the Calcutta Conference.} The shipping conferences appeared 15 years before the enactment of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, one of the first competition laws in the modern world, so cartels themselves were not illegal at that time. Table \ref{tb:industry_history} summarizes the history of liner shipping industry before 2000, with related studies and key legislative changes.

\paragraph{Internal mechanism to conference firms.}
The main purpose of shipping conferences is market stabilization by controlling entry via excess capacity \citep{fusillo2003excess}, predatory pricing \citep{morton1997entry,podolny1999social}, price discrimination \citep{fox1992empirical,clyde1998market}, loyalty contracts \citep{marin2003exclusive}, and so on. To this aim, the shipping conferences agreed on a variety of other matters between the shipping companies in addition to freight rates. The content of the agreements can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) alternatives to suppress freight rate competition among the member shipping companies, (2) alternatives to prevent the outflow of shippers to non-conference shipping companies, and (3) alternatives to directly exclude non-conference vessels.

As a means of avoiding freight rate competition, rate agreements and vessel allocation agreements are concluded among member shipping companies. Rate agreements are signed by conference members to agree on rates for each product and to update rates jointly. Vessel allocation agreements adjust the amount of tonnage to be allocated, the number of voyages, ports of call, operation schedules, and cargoes to be loaded. These features have been modeled as price and quantity fixing cartels.\footnote{For example, \cite{clyde1998market} model the market with the shipping conference as a collusion equilibrium.}

\paragraph{External mechanism for non-conference firms.}
Conference tariff rates (freight rates) decided by these agreements have had public notice, and no specific entry restrictions were imposed on the ocean shipping market. Thus, the market is always subject to competition from non-conferences' vessels and new entrants. For this reason, the shipping conferences introduced the Dual Rate System, the Fidelity Rebate System, and the Differed Rebate System to ensure the effectiveness of the freight rate agreements and prevent shippers from flowing to non-conference shipping companies that offered lower rates than the conferences' tariff rates.\footnote{In the Dual Rate System, a shipper and a shipping conference conclude an exclusive patronage contract/loyalty agreement and provide transportation service for the specific route. The contract rate is lower than the spot rate on the condition that the shipper uses only conference member carriers' service within a specific contract period. The Fidelity Rebate refunds a portion of the freight if the shipper uses only the conference carriers within a specified period (4-6 months). The Differed Rebate System is also an incentive to use conference carriers. Under the system, if a shipper had used only members' services for a specified refundable period (4-6 months), and if it does not use any non-conference members' service for the deferment period following the refundable period, a certain amount of money is refunded upon the shipper's request. The refund amount was usually around 10\% of the freight. \cite{fox1992empirical} uses the US port pair-level data in 1977 to examine the effect of the dual rate contract and consumer loyalty.} These systems are recognized as entry deterrents to promote the stability of the freight rate and liner services.\footnote{For instance, \cite{marin2003exclusive} examine the economic effects of exclusive contracts of ocean shipping cartels during the 1950s between firms and the ultimate consumers of their product. They record that, ``During the congressional investigations of shipping conferences in the late 1950s and early 1960s documents obtained from an ocean carrier contained an admission that ‘the entire contract system is a fighting measure to get rid of outside competition' " (p.198).}

%Moreover, the shipping conferences strictly rejected or restricted the entrance of non-conference firms depending on the supply and demand of the routes. In general, such shipping conferences with membership restrictions are called ``closed conferences".

Conferences also used ``fighting ships," which are vessels temporarily put into service at a similar schedule as non-conference shipping companies and at lower rates. Fighting ships were used to force non-conference shipping companies to leave the route. All the members shared the losses associated with the operation of fighting ships.


After the 1960s, the circumstances and nature of the shipping alliances have changed rapidly and multifacetedly. In particular, technological innovation centered on containerization explained in Section \ref{subsec:inception_of_container_shipping_industry},  and pro-competitive amendments to shipping laws in the United States explained in Section \ref{subsec:shipping_act_of_1984}, have had a major impact on the functioning of shipping alliances and the market competition in the ocean shipping market.

% \subsection{The simple theory of shipping conferences}\label{subsec:simple_theory_of_shipping_conferences}

% To gain intuition about how the shipping conferences between 1966 and 1990 worked, we introduce a simple model. For simplicity, we focus on a single route and the shipping conferences on the route.\footnote{We follow \textit{``UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE OF PLENIPOTENTIARIES ON A CODE OF CONDUCT FOR LINER CONFERENCES"} (CCL) published by the United Nations in 1975.} 

% Any shipping line has the right to be a full member of a conference which serves the foreign trade of its country. The shipping line applying for membership of a conference
% shall provide evidence of its ability such as capacity tonnage. An application for admission  to membership is promptly decided upon, and the decision communicated by a conference to an applicant promptly.\footnote{Chapter II, Article 1 of CCL. In Section \ref{sec:additional_figures}, we show that only two firms were allowed to join the shipping conferences from non-conference markets, whereas more than ten firms withdrew from the shipping conferences.} 

% Given the list of conference members, the shipping conference allocate shipping quantity and impose conference tariff.\footnote{Chapter II, Article 13 of CCL mentions that, ``conference tariffs shall not unfairly differentiate between shippers similarly situated. Shipping lines members of a conference shall adhere strictly to the rates".} Theoretically, this is equivalent to the price and quantity fixing cartel in the homogeneous market. The shipping conference maximizes the profit of the conference market as follows:
% $$
% \arg\max_{P,Q}\pi=(P(Q)-c)Q
% $$
% Under suitable conditions, the first order condition with respect to $P$ and $Q$, 
% \begin{align*}
%     P'Q + P(Q)-c = 0\\
%     Q=0
% \end{align*}


\subsubsection{The inception of the container shipping industry}\label{subsec:inception_of_container_shipping_industry}

The history of container shipping began with Malcolm P. McLean, the founder of the US land transportation company Sea-Land Service.\footnote{\cite{bernhofen2016estimating} and \cite{rua2014diffusion} explain the detailed history of the container shipping industry from the viewpoint of the global trade and country-level development. \cite{levinson2016box} provides an overview of the industry with anecdotal and qualitative evidence.}  As in Table \ref{tb:industry_history}, in 1956, the world's first container ship sailed from the port of Newark, New Jersey, to the port of Houston, Texas. The first international container ship was employed by Sea-Land Service for the transatlantic route in 1966, and for the transpacific route in 1967. On the other hand, for the Asia-Europe route, the first international semi-container ship, the Cornelia Maersk, was employed in 1967. However, the first international full-container ship, the Kamakura-maru, was delayed to start in 1971, which is recognized as the first year of global containerization in the route.

The global containerization induced the following market changes between 1966 and 1990: (1) transforming the cost structure, (2) lowering barriers to entry, (3) stimulating the rise of (non-conference) shipping companies in developing countries, (4) shifting from ``closed" conferences to ``open" conferences, and (5) forming a consortium.

\paragraph{Transforming the cost structure.}
In the 1960s, the volume of cargo movement on ocean liners increased, and port handling costs rose, putting pressure on the management of shipping companies. However, in the US, cargoes were loaded into standardized containers for transport, which not only eliminated the need for onboard cargo handling equipment, but also enabled cargo handling in the rain. In addition, cargo handling in container shipping saved a great deal of the work that used to be done by workers. They greatly reduced time and cost required for cargo handling at ports. On the other hand, containerization made the industry capital intensive.

\paragraph{Lowering barriers to entry.}
The development of containerization has dramatically lowered the barriers to entry for new shipping companies. Prior to the development of containerization, large and small cargoes had to be loaded and unloaded individually, requiring skilled loading techniques and know-how to prevent cargo collapse during the voyage. Before containerization, large and small cargoes had to be loaded and unloaded individually, which required skilled stacking techniques and know-how to prevent cargo collapse during the voyage, and a great deal of time and workforce were required for cargo handling and management. As containerization has progressed, cargo sizes have been standardized, and many stacking techniques and expertise have become unnecessary, significantly reducing the time and labor required for cargo handling.

\paragraph{Rise of (non-conference) shipping companies in developing countries.}
In addition, the governments of various countries and local governments competed to build container terminals, which resulted in the loss of the technological and equipment advantages of existing shipping companies. In this way, the barriers to entry for new shipping companies that did not have technology or bases for loading and unloading dropped significantly.\footnote{Further, containerization has made it possible to quickly reload cargo onto freight trains and trailers, which has led to the rapid development of international intermodal transportation. In the past, shipping companies were contracted to transport goods only by sea between ports and were not involved in inland transportation. The relationship between inland and vessel transportation is investigated by \cite{bernhofen2016estimating} and \cite{levinson2016box} explained it anecdotally. } In parallel with the development of containerization, developing countries and socialist countries began to develop ocean shipping business as a core industry of their countries, and state-owned shipping companies of these countries began to enter the market as non-conference members.

\paragraph{Shifting from the ``closed" conferences to ``open" conferences.}
Also, conferences came to be strongly perceived as an impediment to the entry of developing countries' shipping industries into the world trade market, mainly in the UNCTAD arena. In response to this trend, in 1974, the United Nations Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Shipping Conferences was concluded. The convention allows shipping companies from trading parties to participate in the shipping conference. Moreover, it stipulates that when a conference determines the ratio of cargo transportation by shipping companies, the ratio of origin-destination shipping companies to third-country shipping companies should be 4:4:2. In the 1980s, conferences related to Europe routes began to actively ask non-conference companies to join the conferences to prevent its market share from declining.

\paragraph{Forming a consortium.}
As containerization progressed, container routes required considerable investments in ship construction and container terminal ownership. Therefore, to reduce the scale of investment while maintaining a certain level of service, multiple companies began to form consortiums.\footnote{For example, these consortium includes the TRIO Group, formed by European shipping lines, and the Ace Group, consisting of Japanese, Korean, French, and other shipping lines.} Specifically, the consortiums are engaged in business co-operations such as space chartering, joint use of container terminals, and coordination of operation schedules.\footnote{ Major container shipping companies are forming  global alliances such as THE Alliance and the Ocean Alliance. They are utilizing a consortium framework.} Both ``conference" and ``consortium" are defined as concerted actions by competition laws in various countries, which then require exemptions from competition laws. However, member companies in a conference agree on freight rates, but consortium members do not have any consent. The determination of freight rates, transport frequencies, and sales activities is conducted by individual shipping companies in the consortium.

\subsubsection{Withdrawal of Sea-Land from shipping conferences in 1980}\label{subsec:withdrawal_of_sea-land_from_cartel_in_1980}
In the last years of the 1970s, a substantial increase in competition for transpacific routes put pressure on rates. In 1979, Sea-Land introduced eight SL-7 high-speed container vessels with a speed of 33 knots. These vessels worsen the profitability of the company. The company withdrew from the shipping alliance to ensure its profitability. Former executives of a Japanese shipping company stated in the interview article, ``We had to increase the cargo we loaded, but we could not achieve our goals without leaving the conference that bounds freight rate" \citep{JapanMaritimeDaily2006}. Also, they noted, ``We thought we had no choice but to become a non-alliance carrier and lock in customers by setting freight rates" \citep{JapanMaritimeDaily2006}.

However, because of the conference's dual freight rate system, shippers who had contracts with conference carriers were unwilling to pay the penalty to switch to Sea-Land. On the other hand, at the time, the double freight rate system did not cover only port-to-port cargoes. Therefore, Sea-Land focused on import shippers and intermodal cargoes that were not covered by the double-freight rate system. In addition, the fact that Sea-Land paid the freight cost of returning containers from inland to the port rather than passing it on to shippers has led to a reduction in freight rates.

\subsubsection{The Shipping Act of 1984 in the US}\label{subsec:shipping_act_of_1984}

In the United States, the new Shipping Act was enacted in June 1984 as part of the deregulation policy under the Reagan administration. The aim of the act was to allow member carriers to make individual agreements with shippers on freight rates and services, and to unbind shippers from shipping alliances so that shippers could make more appropriate choices in shipping companies. It drastically changed the competition regime especially in US-related routes.\footnote{\cite{wilson1991some} provide anecdotal evidence and a case study of the effect of the Shipping Act of 1984.}  

First, the Shipping Act of 1984 included the mandatory right to Independent Action (IA). IA refers to a behavior so that a member firm may define independently its freight rates or services that deviate from the conference tariff rates. It means that the guarantee of the right of the member carriers of the shipping conference to set their own rates or services different from those of the alliance under the principle of openness.

Second, the act required conferences to allow the right to form service contracts (SC). SC refers to a contract in which the shipper commits in advance to load a specific quantity or more of cargo to the shipping company during a specific period. Under this contract, the shipping company reserves the space necessary to carry the cargo, and applies discounted freight rates.\footnote{The minimum number of containers promised by the shipper to the shipping company is called the MQC (Minimum Quantity Commitment).}

Third, the act prohibited the Dual Rate System explicitly. The prohibition of the system meant that the shipping conference lost its binding power on shippers, and individual shipping companies frequently exercised their right of independent action, which encouraged competition among shipping companies and led to a significant decline in freight rates on US-related routes.\footnote{\cite{JMC2008} pointed out that the Dual Rate System was the most effective way shipping companies kept their shippers when the conference system was functioning.}  

\paragraph{Stabilization agreement.}
Due to the development of containerization and the weakening of the shipping alliance by the Shipping Act of 1984, the share of non-conference shipping companies became larger, and it became increasingly difficult for conferences to prevent the activities of non-conference shipping companies. For this reason, conference member shipping companies formed a ``stabilization agreement" or "discussion agreement". that incorporates most of the shipping companies on the routes including non-conference shipping companies. 

The purpose of the stabilization agreement is to stabilize shipping routes by exchanging information on trends in supply and demand on shipping routes, as well as by agreeing on guidelines for rate restoration and surcharges. However, it does not have any direct binding power on freight rates. A representative example is the Transpacific Stabilization Agreement (TSA), which was formed in 1989 by 13 shipping companies (nine conference members and four non-conferences) as an agreement to stabilize shipping routes from Asia to North America.\footnote{ TSA was dissolved in 2018. } 

%\textit{Market Structure and Competition Policy in Shipping} (``Kaiun ni okeru Sijou Kouzou to Kyousou Seisaku", in Japanese) published by \cite{kaiun_ni_okeru2004} reports the market environment between 1960 and 2004.

%\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
%\item In Japan and Europe, joint vessel allocation was implemented and consortiums were formed to reduce the burden of capital costs in order to increase the frequency of vessel allocation due to expensive tonnage, while U.S. shipping companies went it alone due to antitrust concerns.
%     \item The antitrust concerns and FEFC made significant differences on Asia-Europe route and other routes. First, transpacific and transatlantic routes are operated by non-conference firms and the ``open" conference which induces approximately a free-entry market, whereas Asia-Europe route is operated by non-conference firms and ``closed conference" such as FEFC, by which shippers were bound by single-handed loading contracts and a double-freight rate system, and their interests were protected by competitive rates and rival allocation of vessels to non-allied vessels.
%\end{enumerate}

% Focusing on the conference markets and internal mechanism of the shipping conferences, Figures \ref{fg:firm_level_market_share_transition_transpacific}, \ref{fg:firm_level_market_share_transition_transatlantic}, \ref{fg:firm_level_market_share_transition_asia_and_europe} illustrate the transitions of market shares of conference firms and Sea-Land on each market. The transition reflects firm-market-year-level entry and exit behavior in the conference market. As a common feature of the data tracking the initial state, the markets in the initial year were highly concentrated because the number of entrant firms was small. As the market was growing, the market shares converged to some stationary distribution.

\section{Structural break test}\label{sec:structural_break_test}

We test multiple unknown structural breaks for each route using \cite{bai1998estimating,bai2003computation}, to confirm anecdotal evidence of container crisis between the 1970s and 1980s, documented in \cite{broeze2002globalisation}, and to find when container crisis started and how long it lasted. Methodologically, we follow \cite{bai2003computation} who address the problem of estimation of the break dates and the number of breaks and present an efficient algorithm.\footnote{The most related paper is \cite{fan2016analysis}, which applies the method of \cite{bai2003computation} to the semi-annual data of the newbuilding price index, the time charter rate index, and the second-hand price index for each ship size (i.e., Feeder, Feedermax, Handy, Sub-Panamax, and Panamax) between October 1996 and July 2013. They focus on the unknown structural breaks of the relationship between the above three global-level indices, whereas we are interested in the unknown structural breaks of route-level container freight rate corresponding with competition regime changes.} 

We consider the multiple linear regression with $k$ breaks ($k + 1$ regimes) as follows:
\begin{align}
    y_{t}=z_{t}^{\prime} \delta_{j}+u_{t} \quad t=T_{j-1}+1, \ldots, T_{j}\label{eq:bai_and_perron}
\end{align}
for $j=1, \ldots, k+1$. In this model, $y_{t}$ is the targeted price at time $t$, $z_{t}(q \times 1)$ is a vector of $q$-dimensional covariates and $\delta_{j}(j=1, \ldots, k+1)$ is the corresponding vector of coefficients, and $u_{t}$ is the disturbance at time $t$. We allow serial correlation in the errors and different variances of the residuals across segments. The indices $\left(T_{1}, \ldots, T_{k}\right)$, i.e., the break points, are explicitly treated as unknown (we use the convention that $T_{0}=0$ and $T_{k+1}=T$ ). 

The purpose of this section is to estimate the unknown regression coefficients together with the break points and the number so that we specify $z_{t}=1$ as the simplest case. \cite{bai2003computation} suggest that trimming parameter $\varepsilon=h/T=0.10$ holds where $h$ is the minimum distance between each break. Following the practical suggestions of \cite{bai2003computation}, we assume a minimum length equal to 10\% of the sample size given that we allow for a maximum of four breaks. Our data specifies $T=40$ (i.e, yearly data between 1966-2007), so that we impose $h=4$ for route-year-level analysis of the shipping price. For consistency, we also impose $h=4$ for industry-year-level analysis of newbuilding, secondhand, and scrap prices.

We use \texttt{strucchange} R-package developed by \cite{zeileis2002strucchange}.
   \end{tablenotes}
   }
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fg:structural_change_transatlantic_eastbound_before_2008} illustrates the estimated break points $\hat{T}_j$ and 95\% confidence intervals for route-year-level analysis of the shipping price. The bottom table shows BIC for all possible number of breaks under $h=4$, where the minimizer of BIC is the optimal break number $\hat{k}$. First, we find that 95\% confidence intervals of the structural break cover the period between 1979 and 1980 on the U.S. routes (left and center panels), whereas the intervals cover the period between 1976 and 1978 on the non-US routes (right panels). This indicates that the container crisis occurred in all six routes at the latest in 1980 triggered by the withdrawal of Sea-Land, although non-US routes reacted earlier than U.S. routes. The reason for non-US routes seems to be related to the supply-demand balance in the market. The supply of container vessels increased after the entry of shipping companies from developing countries and socialist countries after the UNCTAD Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences adopted was adopted in 1974, and the Suez Canal was reopened in 1976 \citep{jsme2022}.

Second, we find remarkable differences between US routes and non-US routes between 1984 and 1990. The 95\% confidence intervals of the structural break cover some period between 1984-1990 on the US routes, whereas there are no breaks on the non-US routes in the period. This implies that the enactment of Shipping Act of 1984 generated some structural breaks on the treatment group, that is, US routes. Surprisingly, we also find that container crisis lasted heterogeneously even within the US routes. For example, transpacific routes seemed to recover in 1986, whereas transatlantic routes went sour until 1990. This result may support the fact that the supply-demand relationship on the Transpacific and Transatlantic routes changed differently in the late 1980s. The substantial change in exchange rates after the Plaza Accord in 1985 led to a recovery in demand for transportation on the transpacific route due to increased exports from Asia and imports from Japan. The recovery of transportation demand on North American routes recovered due to the increase in exports from Asia and imports from Japan. On the other hand, no such situation was observed between Europe and the US.

\item[a]Note: Each segment shows the estimated break points and the 95\% confidence intervals for $\hat{T}_i$ for $i=1,\cdots,4$ for each route. Following \cite{bai2003computation}, the number of break points is selected via minimizing BIC shown in the bottom table. The estimated parameters $\hat{\delta}_j$ and the standard errors (robust to serial correlation) for all $j=1,\cdots,k+1$ for all possible numbers of break points are omitted. We use the sample between 1968 and 1998. We use \texttt{strucchange} R-package developed by \cite{zeileis2002strucchange}.

Figure \ref{fg:structural_change_scrap_price_before_1998} illustrates the estimated break points $\hat{T}_j$ and 95\% confidence intervals for industry-year-level analysis of newbuilding, secondhand, and scrap prices. First, we find that 95\% confidence intervals of the structural break cover the period between 1974 and 1976 for newbuilding and secondhand prices. These correspond with the shipping price trend of Asia-Europe market. Second, the structural breaks of secondhand price are not detected after 1984. This implies that container crisis does not affect second hand price significantly. \textcolor{blue}{[Add explanation]}


\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper provides a new unified panel dataset of route-year-level freight rate and shipping quantity in the six major routes and industry-year-level newbuilding, secondhand, and scrap prices from 1966 (the beginning of the industry) to 2009. The data and structural break tests provide historical insight of nonstationary dynamics of these price variables. Newbuilding price
